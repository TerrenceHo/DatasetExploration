# DatasetExploration
This is my attempt to broaden my knowledge of machine learning while deciding if I liked the field of machine learning.
I explored various datasets and attempted to plot and find correlations between the data.  I used famous datasets such as the Boston Housing, Diabetes Statistics, Haberman, and Wholesale datasets as practice.
Included in this repository are brief scripts written through experimentation, Google, and sklearn's documentation to attempt to apply a Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and K-Means Clustering.
After this introduction to machine learning, I plan to learn the theory of machine learning in Andrew Ng's machine learning course.
